# PlanEat (web mobile app)

We all experience the moment when it's time to eat, and we don't know what to have. We take a moment to think, and when a good idea comes to mind, we open the fridge or pantry, only to find that we don't have what we need. To solve this problem, my partner and I started planning our meals weekly, writing it down on paper. We would jot down the complete list of ingredients we needed and then go to the supermarket to stock up for the week. After a while, we noticed that certain eating patterns repeated themselves, and we decided to create an app that could do all of this for us. That's how PLANEAT came into existence. Below, I'll share how it works.

# Usage

The "Add" button in the navigation bar on the bottom allows you to add items based on the current view. For example, if you are in the "Ingredients" tab and you press it, a modal will open to add ingredients.

## Planners

Here, the user's list of plans will be displayed. You can have as many as you want, with a maximum duration of 2 weeks. The card will show key information about the plan, and upon entering, you will see the details day by day.

# Stats

It is important for a website to load quickly, have good SEO, and prioritize accessibility for the following reasons:

**User Experience:** Fast-loading websites provide a better user experience. Users expect quick access to content, and a slow website can lead to frustration and high bounce rates.

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Good SEO practices help a website rank higher in search engine results. This means more visibility and organic traffic, which can be crucial for the success of an online presence.

**Accessibility:** Prioritizing accessibility ensures that the website is usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. It promotes inclusivity and compliance with legal requirements, enhancing the website's reach and reputation.

That's why I decided to use Google's tool called [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) to ensure that the application complies with the standards of the top search engine today.
